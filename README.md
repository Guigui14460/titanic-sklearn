# Titanic dataset analysis with Scikit-learn
This repo is only used to illustrate a bug from scikit-learn.

The data are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

I followed [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-survival-of-titanic-passengers-30870ccc7e8) to be able to reproduce the phenomenon observed on a private dataset.
